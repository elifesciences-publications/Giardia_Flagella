# Giardia_Flagella

This code is associated with the paper from McInally et al., "Length-dependent disassembly maintains four different flagellar lengths in Giardia". eLife, 2019. http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.48694

This repository contains the scripts I have written for data analysis and generating plots for my dissertation work on flagellar length control in Giardia lamblia.
